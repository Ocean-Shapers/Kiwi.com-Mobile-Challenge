## The Ocean Shapers – Kiwi Mobile App
The Ocean Shapers – Kiwi Mobile App aims to combine the joy of travelling to new countries, obtaining a glimpse into different cultures, and earning special Kiwi flight deals, within the bigger frame of raising awareness for protecting our oceans and rivers from plastic pollution. Our proposed game for Kiwi.com takes the players on a journey around some of the major European flight destinations. After players select their home country at the beginning of the game, they learn about popular sights of selected European destinations through the eyes of the Ocean Shapers Turtle. While progressing through the Danube, Rhine, Seine and Thames rivers, players can unlock new destinations and discover Kiwi.com flight deals during their journey. The game is also built around the concept of raising awareness of environment protection, so the players need to avoid plastic objects as they cross the European rivers, and they can also learn about various environment protection initiatives of the selected travel destinations after progressing through the map in the game.


## Our Mission
To bring a novel experience to people all around the world about impact creation through our innovative approach and solutions, that integrate into the daily life.


## Our Vision
We believe in together shaping all the oceans, seas and rivers into their natural condition.


## About Ocean Shapers
Ocean Shapers develops a platform for video gaming, sustainable shopping, and contributing to environment protection via gamifying the activity of ocean plastic collection and visualizing the impact creation process for the users. The main element of the platform is the Ocean Shapers application that is themed to reflect the ocean plastic collection process. The application integrates content (photos and videos) that visualizes the impact of real-world ocean plastic collection that is funded by the users who interact with the gamified elements. In order to progress in the application, the users need to place real-world financial contributions. Each level is designed in the game to visualize the same scale of impact that the user creates in the real-world by his/her collective contribution that he/she has placed in the application so far to reach that specific level.
